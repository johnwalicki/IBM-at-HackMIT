# IBM Challenge

### IBM Challenge prompt:
```
“The impacts of climate change are global in scope and unprecedented in scale. Without drastic action today, adapting to these impacts in the future will be more difficult and costly.” United Nations
```

### Challenge

The **2021 IBM Call for Code Challenge for HackMIT** asks participants to use one or more IBM Cloud services to build sustainable open source solutions that help halt and reverse the impact of climate change, with a focus specifically on:

- **Clean Water and Sanitation** - Water is the natural resource that is most threatened by climate change and a prerequisite for life on earth. From intelligent solutions for small farmers to recycling showers, technology can make a significant impact on the availability of water and its consumption.
- **Zero Hunger** - 135 million people suffer from acute hunger, with climate change a major contributing factor. Technology can help grow more crops in areas on the edge of drought or quickly distribute perishables from small stores to local homeless shelters.
- **Economic Consumption and Production** - Worldwide consumption and production drives the global economy yet is inextricably linked to the environment. Technology can help make recommendations on energy efficiency to highlighting the carbon footprint of online purchases.

### Tech Requirements:
Must use at least one IBM Technology or IBM Cloud service as a part of your solution and call out which IBM Technology being used in your abstracts and/or video.
